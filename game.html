<p>I AM ME
Not by Name
But by Perspectives 
Not by Character
But by Actions
Not by Descripition
But by Attributes
All of these and more lives in ME alone</p>
<p>JUNE 02
At times, it speaks to me and makes me realize there's more to this more to this world. Different question, Curiosity even if it is not a part of my Zodiac.

Lately, I've lost interest in a whole lot of things.
No movies, No friends, No physical meetups, Enjoys being alone, don't wanna talk to people, Staying away from Crowd, Likes indoor.</p>
